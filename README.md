***Under condstruction - Use at your own risk***

This repo contains R scripts for processing Sanger sequencing <code>.ab1</code> files, and for generating descriptive statistic tables regarding the QC steps implemented.

Expected input: 
- 16S rRNA gene sequences in <code>.ab1</code> format
- Designed specifically for V3-V6 region amplicons sequenced 5'-3' backwards from V6 to V3 (i.e., reverse complement sequences)
